# **Dangers Near and Far: Narrative Positions in Science, Seafaring, and the Novel, 1660-1860** {#dissertation-title}


My book project, *Dangers Near and Far: Narrative Positions in Science, Seafaring, and the Novel, 1660-1860*, introduces a new narratological concept, narrative position, and corresponding method, positional reading. Positional reading works by asking where a story is told from; narrative position is the answer to that question. I show how this method can connect narrative with knowledge and geography by linking narrative position to epistemic position and spatial position. I model this method through a literary history of the virtual position: a highly mobile, disembodied vantage that conveys observations detached from any person or group of people, yet which remains limited to uncertain judgments about appearances rather than perfect knowledge of what is there. The virtual position is signaled by features including the passive voice, subjunctive mood, nominalizations, and an emphasis on objects. It is closely related to scientific objectivity and especially prevalent in contemporary scientific writing. I show how this position developed in relation to other narrative positions across British scientific writing, maritime literature, and prose fiction from 1648 to 1859. My guiding argument is that the virtual position consolidated as a way to manage the large-scale dangers of expanding overseas empire, those terrifying threats to survival that lurked obscurely somewhere between the near and the far. Key authors include Robert Boyle, William Dampier, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Charlotte Smith, Ann Radcliffe, and Charles Darwin, as well as other Royal Society natural philosophers, seafarers, and novelists.

# My book project, *Dangers Near and Far: Virtual Positions in Science, Seafaring, and the Gothic*, my dissertation, connects narrative form and ways of knowing. Turning to British writing from the mid-seventeenth to late-eighteenth centuries, I trace the consolidation of the virtual position, a disembodied, abstracted observer that corresponds to nobody. I track the refinement of this eerie position through an interchange among scientific writing, maritime literature, and terrifying fiction, especially the Gothic. The virtual position became a broadly-applied literary technology because it negotiated the social and material perils of knowing across a dispersed maritime empire, serving especially as a way to represent, inspire, and manage terrors--dangers that hover between the near and the far. I conclude that this major epistemic standard, one central to scientific knowledge, is symbiotic with the terrors accompanying the construction of colonial space, where to know is to terrorize and to be terrified.

# Along the way, I consider how the virtual position works alongside other narrative positions, such as the personal or the collective, offering positional readings of authors such as the early Royal Society member Robert Boyle, buccaneer naturalist William Dampier, Royal Navy captain James Cook and his botanist passenger Joseph Banks. I discuss a host of fiction writers and genres, including Daniel Defoe and adventure fiction, Samuel Richardson and sentimentalism, and Ann Radcliffe and the Gothic--the last of which, I argue, most fully embraces the virtual and best expresses the links among terror, science, and colonial power.
# While *Dangers* has implications for narratology, geography, and legal history, my main concern is how position can help us see science's symbiosis with empire and the consequences for our collective endangerment. As such, I end by considering what kinds of alternative positions are available to imagine how they would inform a decolonial science.
