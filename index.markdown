<img src="https://alexander-j-sherman.github.io/Sherman_headshot.jpg" width="30%" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" /> I am a Ph.D. candidate in English literature studying literature and science, along with the digital humanities, the geography of colonialism, and the oceanic humanities. I work at Stanford University, where I am part of the [Core Research Team of the Stanford Literary Lab](https://litlab.stanford.edu). 

My driving research interest is considering the formal features of British eighteenth-century writing to help understand the long shadow that empire continues to cast over our world and our knowledge of it: how, for example, narrative perspective in Gothic fiction connects to epistemic norms in science and to the spatial manuevers of colonial seafaring. My work has appeared or is forthcoming in *PMLA*, a Cambridge Critical Concepts volume on *Space and Literary Studies*, *Eighteenth-Century Studies*, and *Cultural Analytics* and *Post45*.

I have designed and taught courses spanning British and postcolonial literature, epidemiology, science and technology studies, the digital humanities, and computer science. 

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a mathematics teacher and tutor, and I received a B.A. with comprehensive honors in mathematics and English from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
