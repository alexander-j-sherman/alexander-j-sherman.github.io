At Stanford University, I developed and taught the following courses:

- [*Pathogens and Populations: Representing Infectious Disease*](https://alexander-j-sherman.github.io/syllabus_P-and-P.pdf), co-taught with [Mallory Harris](https://mjharris95.github.io): This course compared scientific and cultural representations of infectious disease (e.g., plays and systems of differential equations; counterfactual documentary and counterfactual models). Such comparisons helped students question the underlying assumptions and limits in our attempts to describe populations, infection, illness, and death. The course was also covered in the [*Stanford Report*](https://news.stanford.edu/report/2023/01/03/students-examine-scientific-cultural-representations-disease/).

- [*Travel and Education*](https://alexander-j-sherman.github.io/Sherman-Syllabus_Travel-and-Education_Final.pdf): This writing-intensive seminar considered how two common prongs of individual development are education and travel, which are often combined in institutions like university study abroad. To interrogate this connection and, ultimately, how educational systems (formal and informal) work, we read travel writings and *Bildungsromane* from the eighteenth century to the present, and students crafted a long final research paper on texts of their choosing.

- [*Literary Text Mining*](https://alexander-j-sherman.github.io/ENG184E_Syllabus.pdf): This course introduces students to computational literary studies by focusing on a foundational method: counting words. Students learn to frame literary critical research questions, computational inquiries based on them, and collaborate on digital humanities projects by considering Jane Austenâ€™s fiction alongside thousands of Austen fanfiction stories, using RStudio and the R programming language. 

I was a teaching assistant for:

- *The Public Life of Science and Technology*, taught by Professors Paul Edwards and John Willinksy, the introductory course for Stanford's Science, Technology, and Society program. Structured by Professors Edwards and Willinsky as a course on both climate science and intellectual property.

- *Introduction to Modern Literature*, taught by Professor Roanne Kantor, a required course on post-1900 literary history for Stanford's English major. Structured by Professor Kantor as an introduction to Cold War and post-Cold War exchanges among fiction from the United States, Latin America, and South Asia.

I mentored undergraduate theses by:

- Valerie Trapp (as advisor), for a Human Rights Capstone, "Tourism 3.0", on spiritual tourism in the Dominican Republic, 2023

- Arielle DeVito (as graduate mentor), for an English Honors Thesis, "Life in the Margins: Minor Characters in Katherine Mansfield's Short Stories", 2022 (Faculty Advisor: Alice Staveley)


Prior to graduate school, I worked in Chicago Public Schools as a mathematics (mostly algebra, some geometry) teacher and tutor. As an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I worked in the Writing Center as a [Writing Fellow](https://writing.wisc.edu/writingfellows/about/), an embedded peer writing tutor for courses across many disciplines.
